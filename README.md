# Admin User Management System

## Overview
This project is a simple admin user management system built using core PHP with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and Bootstrap for the front-end. It includes functionalities such as admin login, registration, user management (add, edit, delete), and session-based authentication with cache control to prevent unauthorized access.

## Features
- Admin registration and login with secure password hashing
- Session-based authentication and access control
- CRUD operations for users (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Protection of routes and pages for authenticated users only
- Prevention of browser caching after logout to secure session data
- Responsive UI using Bootstrap 5
- Clean and professional folder structure

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Set up a local server environment such as XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP.
3. Import the database schema (MySQL) for admins and users tables.
4. Update database credentials in `/config/Database.php`.
5. Place the project folder inside your serverâ€™s `htdocs` or equivalent.
6. Access the app via `http://localhost/loges/index.php`.

## Usage

- Register a new admin via `index.php?page=register`.
- Manage users via the dashboard after logging in.
- Add, edit, or delete users from the dashboard.
- Logout to securely end the session.

## Security

- Passwords are hashed using `password_hash()` and verified with `password_verify()`.
- Sessions are securely managed and destroyed on logout.
- Cache-control headers prevent browser caching of sensitive pages.
- Access to protected pages is restricted to authenticated admins only.
